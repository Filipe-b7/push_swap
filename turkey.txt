turkey sort

-10 numbers example

you will have to push the numbers of stack a to stack in b 
so they stay in descending order



	-push 2 numbers to stack b in order to have an maximum without checking anything

DO IT UNTIL STACK A HAS 3 NUMBERS(THE MAGIC NUMBER)
	-find the cheapest number to push from stack a 
	to stack(the nr in stack a has to be on
	 top and in stack b can be top or bottom)

	-SORT STACK A (ONLY 1 OR 2 OPERATIONS)

	-ROTATE A UNTIL ITS THE CORRECT POSITION 
	TO PUSH FROM STACK B TO A AND STAYS ORDERED


	-IN THE FINAL, IF THE MINIMU NR IS NOT IN THE TOP, 
	HE ?MAYBE WILL HAVE TO ROTATE UNTIL IT IS?
